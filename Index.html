              This is one of the most controversial and debated topics of all time. After countless sleepless nights, I decided to
              to delve into this mystery and uncover the truth once and for all. Here are 6 major differences between the seemingly indistinguishable animals.
              Makes sure to <span class="bold">pay attention</span>, as there will be a quiz afterward!
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Ears: Llamas have longer, banana-shaped ears. Alpacas have short spear-shaped ears.</li>
              <li>Weight: Llamas can get as heavy as 400 pounds, while Alpacas generally weigh around 150 pounds. </li>
              <li>Face: Llamas have long faces, whereas an alpaca's face generally appears more blunt or smooshed.</li>
              <li>Purpose: Llamas have been bread for use as pack animals and for meat. Alpacas have been bread primarily for their fiber.</li>
              <li>Hair: Alpacas produce finer fiber than llamas. Alpacas also produce more fleece in a wider variety of colors. </li>
              <li>Disposition: Llamas are more independent minded, while Alpacas are definitely herd animals.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4 class="center">QUIZ TIME!</h4>
            <p class="center">You just read more about llamas and alpacas than you care to know. Now let's put it to the test. <br /><br />
              <span class="bold">Llama or alpaca??</span>

                    alert("Try Again!");

          <img src="mypic.jpg" />

          <p>
            First and foremost, if you read through the website you would know there is something off about my picture. Yes, that's right. That is in fact an
            alpaca, not a llama. This picture was taken years ago in my home country of Ecuador. I've lived the majority of my life in a small town in the southern
            tip of Texas called McAllen. I've heard summers are pretty rough in Las Vegas, but rest assured I've persevered through heat and humidity my whole life.
            I'm currently a junior at The University of Texas at Austin majoring in Business Honors, MIS, and Urban Studies with a certificate in computer science.<br /><br />

            Over the summer, I self-taught myself web development because I thought it was an incredibly useful tool to have. If I'm being completely honest, I
            am not the best or most experienced web developer out there. However, let me give you some reasons why I should receive an interview. I pride myself on continuously seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn, so you can be sure that I will
            be able to adapt to Zappos' business and engineering needs. I'm currently enrolled in the most challenging class in my degree, MIS 333K Web Applications.
            Our project for the semester is to build an iTunes clone, so you can be sure that I will have significantly more experience as both a front-end and back-end
            developer by the time the internship rolls around. I think front-end development is a really fun and exciting creative exercise. I'm particularly interested in how the
            front-end can utilize customer insights to impact the user experience and consequently business outcomes. I would love to be a part of Zappos' driven and entrepreneurial
            culture. I will prepare diligently for the internship to ensure that my skills exceed expectations.
